Compilation Guide
1. Input current directory of project folder under currentDirectory in ProcessManagement.java; line 7.

**Ensure instruction set is in the same project folder
2. Input filepath of instruction file under instructionSet in ProcessManagement.java; line 9.

3. Compile project by executing command "javac ProcessManagement.java" in terminal

4. Run project by executing command "java ProcessManagement" in terminal

-----------------------------------------------------------------
The aim of the this assignment is to traverse a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in parallel, which nodes consists of processes. 

We achieve this goal by making use of threads. 

First we attempt to execute each node process in their own individual thread.(ProcessManagement.java;line 20) The node will only execute iff all parent nodes have finished executing, else it will idle. (ProcessGraphNode.java; line 116)

Once a node process has completed, it will attempt to execute its child process. (ProcessGraphNode.java; line 150)

As a result of this interaction, nodes will not busy wait for their parent nodes to complete and will instead be executed when all the parent nodes have finished executing.
